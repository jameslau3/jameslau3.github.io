            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is James Lau. I recently graduated at the University of Washington with a B.S. in Computer Science. 
                Thank you for choosing to learn more about me! I am a Chinese American who was born in the state of Washington. 
                I currently work two jobs, one as a server and the other as a janitorial manager. As said before I am pursuing a career
                in the tech industry. I have a wide range of experience, this includes work with game development, web development, databases
                mobile app development, and more. I currently live a balanced life and keep a routine of work, exercise, and 
                learning. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, going to the gym, and hiking. I am always looking to 
                learn more, improve my skills, and take on new opportunities.
